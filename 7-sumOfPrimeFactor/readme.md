Sum of Prime Factors
Create a sumOfPrimeFactors() function that takes in an integer n and returns the sum of all of its prime factors. As a reminder, a prime number is a number whose only factors are one and itself. Therefore, a prime factor is a factor of a given number that itself is a prime number.

For example, sumOfPrimeFactors(91) should return 20 since its prime factors are 13 and 7.
