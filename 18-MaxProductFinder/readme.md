MAX PRODUCT FINDER
Max Product Finder
Create a maxProductFinderK() function that takes in a list of numbers and an integer k, and returns the largest product that can be attained from any k integers in the list. You may presume that the length of the list of integers is greater than or equal to k.

For example, maxProductFinderK([-8, 6, -7, 3, 2, 1, -9], 2) should return 72 and maxProductFinderK([-8, 6, -7, 3, 2, 1, -9], 3) should return 432.
